Initializing Variables
Before a variable can be used it must be given an initial value. This is called initializing the variable. If we try to use a variable without first giving it a value:

 int numberOfDays;
 //try and add 10 to the value of numberOfDays
 numberOfDays = numberOfDays + 10;
 
the compiler will throw an error:
 variable numberOfDays might not have been initialized
